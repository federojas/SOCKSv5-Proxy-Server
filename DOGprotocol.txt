                        SOCKS Authentication Protocol 

Status of this Memo

   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  


Acknowledgments

   This document describes a protocol that is designed to interact with a Socks5d
   server and obtain metrics from it. It is a session oriented protocol which works 
   over TCP. 

1.  Introduction

   This protocol is intended to provide tools for a client in order to obtain certain 
   information over a running Socks5d server. The client can make requests asking for 
   the historic amount of connections over the server, the quantity of concurrent connections
   in the server and the quantity of bytes transfered in the server, between other things. This protocol does not 
   assure that the metrics are non volatile, meaning that if the server reboots, the statistics 
   may be lost. 
   As this protocol is  session oriented, operations such as adding or deleting user,
   setting a password and ending a connection, are needed.

   Based on socks5d protocol and Username/Password Authentication for SOCKS V5 (rfc 1928 and 1929).

2.  Initial negotiation
    
   The client establishes a TCP connection with the server.
   
   Once the connection with the SOCKS V5 server has started, the client
   must send the log in data by producing an Username/Password request:

           +----+------+----------+------+----------+
           |VER | ULEN |  UNAME   | PLEN |  PASSWD  |
           +----+------+----------+------+----------+
           | 1  |  1   | 1 to 255 |  1   | 1 to 255 |
           +----+------+----------+------+----------+
           
   The VER field contains the current version of the subnegotiation,
   which is 0x00.

      o The ULEN field contains the length of the UNAME field that follows.
      o The UNAME field contains the username as known to the source operating system (in ASCII charset).
      o The PLEN field contains the length of the PASSWD field that follows.
      o The PASSWD field contains the password association with the given UNAME.

   The server verifies the supplied UNAME and PASSWD, and sends the
   following response:
   
                        +----+--------+
                        |VER | STATUS |
                        +----+--------+
                        | 1  |   1    |
                        +----+--------+

   o A STATUS field of 0x00 indicates connection succedeed.
   o A STATUS field of 0x01 indicates connection failed by incorrect user/password
   o A STATUS field of 0x02 indicates an invalid version
   o A STATUS field of 0x03 indicates a server error
  
   In case of failure, the server returns a 'failure' (any STATUS value different than 0x00)
   status, it MUST close the connection.
   
   In case of succesfull connection (STATUS value 0x00), the session is established.

3.  General request structure

   Once the client is authenticated (and in consequence, the session with the server is established).
   All client request MUST contain the following base structure (and then according to each request can add different parameters): 
   
                     +------+-----+
                     | TYPE | CMD |
                     +------+-----+
                     |   1  |  1  |
                     +------+-----+

   Where TYPE refers to the command type, which can be:
      0x00 for a Query request
      0x01 for a Modification request
      0x02 for Ending connection
   
   and CMD refers to the specific command for each TYPE.

   The associated CMD values for Query requests are the following:
      o  0x00 to get the list of users
      o  0x01 to get the historic amount of connections over the server
      o  0x02 to get the concurrent connections quantity
      o  0x03 to get the quantity of bytes transfered in the server
      o  0x04 to get the status of the password spoofing over the server
      o  0x05 to get the status of the password spoofing over the server
      o  0x06 to get access to the logs of the server

Log access 
   
   The associated CMD values for Modification request are the following:
      o  0x00 to Add a user 
      o  0x01 to Delete a user 
      o  0x02 to set a new password 
      o  0x03 to set a user admin priviledges
      o  0x04 to toggle password spoofing in the server
    

      
   In case of Ending a connection no CMD value is needed. TODO: AGREGAR COMANDOS DE CMD ACA SI HACEN FALTA

4.  General response structure

   As well as in the general request structure, every server response will contain a
   general base structure as it follows (and then according to each request can add different parameters):

   TODO: TENDRIA SENTIDO SACAR EL STATUS FIELD Y Q CUANDO HAYA UN ERROR DEVUELVA UN TYPE INEXISTENTE? Y DE ESA FORMA AHORRARNOS EL BYTE DE STATUS (para mi que no)
                     +--------+-------+----------+
                     |  TYPE  |  CMD  |  STATUS  |
                     +--------+-------+----------+
                     |   1    |   1   |    1     |
                     +--------+-------+----------+

  In which CMD refers to the command requested, TYPE refers to the type requested and STATUS refers to the request status,
  and its values can be:

      o 0x00 succedeed
      o 0x01 general server failure
      o 0x02 unsupported type
      o 0x03 unsupported command

      TODO:  o  X'09' to X'FF' unassigned --> hace falta aclarar algo con esto?

            o In case ROLE of the user making the request is 0x00, it means that the user making the request doesn't have 
              admin priviledges, in consecuence, the password must match with the actual password of 
              the UNAME user

            o In case ROLE of the user making the request is 0x01, it means that the user making the request do have 
              admin priviledges, in consecuence, the password field will not be evaluated.

         PLEN.NEW and PASSWD.NEW are the same  type as PLEN and PASSWD and contains the new password 
         specifications.
         It is important to specify that the UNAME value must exist in order to be deleted.

            o In case ROLE of the user making the request is 0x00, it means that the user making the request doesn't have 
              admin priviledges, in consecuence, the password must match with the actual password of 
              the UNAME user

            o In case ROLE of the user making the request is 0x01, it means that the user making the request do have 
              admin priviledges, in consecuence, the password field will not be evaluated.

      6.1.3  Give a user admin priviledges

            //TODO: ESTO NO SE SI ESTA BIEN, CUALQUIER USUARIO PODRIA HACERSE ADMIN

            To set a  new password for a user, the following  structure is required:

                  +------+----------+------+----------+
                  | ULEN |  UNAME   | PLEN |  PASSWD  |

                  +------+----------+------+----------+

           In which the fields are the same specified in 6.1.1 and in 2.
           It is relevant to state that this command can only be excecuted by users with admin role, meaning 
           that only an admin can make an existing user admin. In other case, the request will not be evaluated.

      6.1.4 Toggle password spoofing

            In order to toggle password spoofing in the server, the client MUST have admin priviledges.
            This request must contain the following structure:
            
                  +--------+-------+---------------+

                  +--------+-------+---------------+
                  |   1    |   1   |       1       |
                  +--------+-------+---------------+

            As it was previously specified, in this case TYPE must be 0x01 and CMD must be 0x04
            and SPOOFING is a 1 byte long unsigned integer.
               0x00 to turn spoofing OFF
               0x01 to turn spoofing ON 
   
   6.2   Modification Responses  

         All modification requests have the following response structure:

                  +-------+-----+----------+
                  |  TYPE | CMD |  STATUS  |
